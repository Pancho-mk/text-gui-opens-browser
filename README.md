# text-gui-opens-browser
When you search in Google do you find often that the first 3 results usually are enough to find what are you looking for?  Are tired of opening all the time this 3 links and you want to be more eficient?

This is a Python 3.6 script that takes a text into a graphical user interface made with Tkinter and opens the first 3 links from Google search into the default browser.
Unfortunately this googlesearch library returns also the sub-links from the first link. I was wondering if there is a way to change that while using this library or it is better to go back with Beautiful Soup and requests in order to fix this issue..
